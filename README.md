# Intro  
learning platform to host user created courses 

# Objectives
* Using this platform to enhance my understanding of Django
* progress CRUD practices
* practice quaility CI/CD

# Work in Progress
* Creating models for instructors to input course materials (courses, modules)
* Creating ability to easily move created course materials around, edit, and delete (CRUD stuff with a little ajax)

## Future work
* create a home page 
  * Gonna do that after I hash out the course material so I know what to link to on the home page (actually, after login)
* Set up models for people to register for instructor created courses 
  ** Probably gonna do this before home page because it might be easier to link this to the home page when I create it 
* Put this on a platform like GCP, AWS or maybe use Heroku again 
  
### Nice to have
* I would like to create an API for this platform, but I first need to learn how to do that and how to string it all together
* Build a chat room...chat rooms are in everything now days :)
